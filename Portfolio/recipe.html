  <tr>
    <td>3 ½ cups flour</td>
  </tr>
    <tr> <td>4 large eggs</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>2 teaspoons orange extract</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>1 ¾ teaspoons baking powder</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>¼ teaspoon salt</td> </tr>

    <tr> <td>2 cups sugar</td>  </tr>
    <tr> <td>¾ cup whole milk</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>2 oranges</td> </tr>
</table>

<h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 325ºF.</li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt until well combined.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, beat butter until light and fluffy and then add sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing in between one.</li>
      <li>Combine 2 tablespoons of orange zest and 1/4 cup orange juice with milk.</li>
      <li>Combine the butter mixture, orange extract and zest.</li>
      <li>Add 1/3 of the dry mixture to the butter mixture and then 1/3 of the milk mixture. Mix in between each addition and continue in thirds until all ingredients are well combined.</li>
      <li>Add a few drops of orange food coloring and mix.</li>
      <li>Pour the batter into a greased and lined cake pan and use a spatula to smooth out the top. Bake for about 45 minutes.</li>
      <li>Once the cake has cooled completely, cut it into quarters. Create crumbs by rubbing the two pieces of cake against each other into a bowl. Fold in buttercream frosting.</li>
      <li>Roll a tablespoon of the mix into a ball and place it on a parchment lined baking sheet. Repeat for as many cake pops as desired and then refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Insert a lollipop stick into the bottom of each pop. Dip the end of the stick in white candy melt and then place it back in the hole. Return the pop to the baking sheet and do this for the rest.</li>
      <li>Dip each cake pop into candy melt and then lift it, allowing any excess drip off. Stick each pop into a Styrofoam stand. Do this for the rest of the pops.</li>
      <li>Spread a little candy melt on the bottom of each licorice and then place one on top of each cake pop for BB-8’s head.</li>
      <li>Dye small batches of royal icing orange, gray, and black and then place each color in a decorating bag.</li>
      <li>Use a #2 tip to pipe the outline for BB-8’s orange circles and then make 4 notches inside of each circle, equally spaced apart. With a #1 decorating tip, pipe details with gray royal icing.</li>
      <li>With black royal icing, make one large dot on BB-8’s head. Let that dry and then use the gray and orange to finish the details.</li>
      <li>TaDa! These Star Wars BB-8 Cake Pops would get a torch thumbs up from BB-8 himself!</li>

<h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 325ºF</li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, almond meal, baking powder, and salt.</li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, use a hand mixer to cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add vanilla extract.</li>
      <li>Add eggs, one at a time, mixing between each one.</li>
      <li>On low speed, alternate adding the flour mixture and the milk to the butter mixture, beginning and ending with he flour mixture.</li>
      <li>Pour the batter into greased pans and then smooth.</li>
      <li>Bake for 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely before refrigerating for about an hour.</li>
      <li>Use a large serrated knife to level the cakes and then remove them from pans.</li>
      <li>Stabilize one of the cakes by cutting off a small piece of the bottom of the round part, and then stack the cakes.</li>
      <li>Gently press an ice cream scoop into the cake to mark a small cavity for the Super Laser Focus Lens, about an inch above the equator of the Death Star. Use a small knife to cut out a cavity.</li>
      <li>Dye some of the frosting gray with a couple drops of black food coloring. Spread the frosting in between the two cakes and then stack them again.</li>
      <li>Spread a thick layer of gray frosting all around the cake and then let sit for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>To make the equator around the Death Star, take a piece of floss, pull it tight, and gently wrap it around the cake and make an indent. Repeat for the lower mid-hemisphere trench. </li>
      <li>To make the polar trench at the top of the Death Star, turn a small bowl upside down and gently press it onto the cake. </li>
      <li>Use a #6 tip to pipe gray lines onto the marked areas for the polar trench, the equator, the mid-hemisphere trench, and the two circles of the Super Laser Focus Lens.</li>
      <li>Use a toothpick to trace two more trenches that intersect with the Super Laser Focus Lens. Pipe some more icing into these trenches with a #3 tip.</li>
      <li>Continue piping frosting onto the cake to make the details of the Death Star. Add as many or as few as you like.</li>
      <li>TaDa! The Star Wars Death Star Cake is ready to soar throughout the dark side of the galaxy!</li>

    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>Over the past few weeks, we have been constantly learning about the different parts of HTML, what they mean and the different ways to use it. It has been a very eye opening experiance to be able to understand the things that I see on my screen everyday and I think that it is very important for other people to understand this too.</p>
    <p>Hyper-text Markup Language is a basic way of creating a web page. It is mostly used for the basic structure and layout of the things that will eventually form to create this page. Once you know how to use it, it is very fun to play around with and not only learn even more about it but always continue to create new things.</p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>Even though they might seem very similar to some people, CSS and HTML are completley different. Unlike HTML, CSS focuses on the more stylish part of a website rather than the structure. It is a great way to put your visions to life by making your site unique and different from the rest.</p>
    <p>CSS makes it easy for people to specify different decorations and the ways in which HTML tags should be displayed for the viewer of the site. Having learned more about this, I have grown to appretiate the stylish part of a website more than I used to because of knowing how much hard work and precision it takes to do so.</p>
